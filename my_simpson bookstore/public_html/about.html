   <p>The Simpson Bookstore was put together to ease college students into their courses and overall campus</p>
   <p>life by providing an array of items essential for those wishing to excel in their academics.  </p>
   <p>We take a bunch of normal business and class related items and put our little twist on them, </p>
   <p>the ol' storm twisteroo.  We would like to give much thanks to all of the staff members here,</p>
   <p> students that attend and those who have taken the time to browse our site online.</p>
   <p> All purchases are final</p>
   <h1>THANK YOU!</h1>
